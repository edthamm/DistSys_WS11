This is a project I had to complete for Distributed Systems at the 
technical university in Vienna. 

I got a B on the course (an A on the practical part you see here).

I do not have the specs on my drive anymore so I can't provide them.
But the basic idea was to provide a platform for distributed/cloudi-like
computing.

There is a manager that handles requests by companies/users and hands them
down to task engines. They are turned on and off on demand, to be sort of
energy efficient.

There is a known bug with synchronisation. It effects the display and
scheduling of task engines, precisely their turning on and of again.
Cost me some points that.

Different stages of handing it in for evaluation are denoted by the
branches.
